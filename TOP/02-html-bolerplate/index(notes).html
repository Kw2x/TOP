<!--We should always name the HTML file that will contain the homepage of our websites 
This is because web servers will by default look for an index.html page when users land on our websites - and not having one will cause big problems.-->

<!-- Every HTML page starts with a doctype declaration. The doctype’s purpose is to tell the browser what version of HTML 
it should use to render the document. The latest version of HTML is HTML5, and the doctype for that version is simply <!DOCTYPE html>.-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--After we declare 
the doctype, we need to provide an <html> element. This is what’s known as the root element of the document, meaning 
that every other element in the document will be a descendant of it.-->

</html lang ="en">
</html>
<!--
lang attribute specifies the language of the text content in that element. This attribute 
is primarily used for improving accessibility of the webpage. It allows assistive technologies, for example screen readers, to adapt according to 
the language and invoke correct pronunciation.
-->

<head>
<!--
The <head> element is where we put important meta-information about our webpages, and stuff required for our webpages to render correctly in 
the browser. Inside the <head>, we should not use any element that displays content on the webpage.
-->

<meta charset="utf-8">
<!--
We should always have the meta tag for the charset encoding of the webpage in the head element: <meta charset="utf-8">
Setting the encoding is very important because it ensures that the webpage will display special symbols and characters 
from different languages correctly in the browser.
-->

<title> 
<!--
Another element we should always include in the head of an HTML document is the title element: <title>My First Webpage</title>
The title element is used to give webpages a human-readable title which is displayed in our webpage’s browser tab.

If we didn’t include a title element, the webpage’s title would default to its file name. In our case that would 
be index.html, which isn’t very meaningful for users; this would make it very difficult to find our webpage if 
the user has many browser tabs open.
-->

<body>
<!--
The final element needed to complete the HTML boilerplate is the <body> element. This is where all the content 
that will be displayed to users will go - the text, images, lists, links, and so on.
The body element also goes within the HTML element and is always below the head element.
-->

<!--
To trigger the shortcut, delete everything in the index.html file and just enter ! on the first line. 
This will bring up a couple of options. Press the enter key to choose the first one, and voila, you should 
have all the boilerplate populated for you.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>

<body>Hello World!</body>
