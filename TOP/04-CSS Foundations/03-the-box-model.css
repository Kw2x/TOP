/* 
The first important concept that you need to understand to be successful in CSS is the box model. It isn’t complicated, 
but skipping over it now will cause you much frustration down the line.

Every single thing on a webpage is a rectangular box. These boxes can have other boxes in them and can sit alongside one another. 
You can get a rough idea of how this works by sticking a border on every item on the page like this:
 */
 * {
    border: 2px solid red;
  }

/* 
if you wanna space two elements away from each other use margin.
if you wanna spcae out an element from itself use padding 
if you wanna have the actual height and weight set insted of margin collapse of an element use border box. 
box-sizing: border-box
*/
