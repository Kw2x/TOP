Block vs Inline
Most of the elements that you have learned about so far are block elements. In other words, their default style is display: block. 
By default, block elements will appear on the page stacked atop each other, each new element starting on a new line.

Inline elements, however, do not start on a new line. They appear in line with whatever elements they are placed beside. A clear example of an inline element is a link, 
or <a> tag. If you stick one of these in the middle of a paragraph of text, it will behave like a part of the paragraph. (Like this…) The link’s text will sit alongside other words in that paragraph. 
Additionally, padding and margin behave differently on inline elements. In general, you do not want to try to put extra padding or margin on inline elements.

Inline-block elements behave like inline elements, but with block-style padding and margin. Inline-block is a useful tool to know about, but in practice, 
you’ll probably end up reaching for flexbox more often if you’re trying to line up a bunch of boxes. Flexbox will be covered in-depth in the next lesson.

Divs and Spans
We can’t talk about block and inline elements without discussing divs and spans. All the other HTML elements we have encountered so far give meaning to their content. For example, 
paragraph elements tell the browser to display the text it contains as a paragraph. Strong elements tell the browser which texts within are important and so on. 
Yet, divs and spans give no particular meaning to their content. They are just generic boxes that can contain anything

Having elements like this available to us is a lot more useful than it may first appear. We will often need elements that serve no other purpose than to be “hook” elements. 
We can give an id or class to target them for styling with CSS. Another use case we will face regularly is grouping related elements under one parent element to 
correctly position them on the page. Divs and spans provide us with the ability to do this.

Div is a block-level element by default. It is commonly used as a container element to group other elements. Divs allow us to divide the page into different blocks and apply styling to those blocks.

  Span is an inline-level element by default. It can be used to group text content and inline HTML elements for styling and should only be used when no other semantic HTML element is appropriate.

  Normal Flow
  As detailed in the last lesson introducing layout, elements on a webpage lay out in normal flow if you haven't applied any CSS to change the way they behave.
  Starting with a solid, well-structured document that's readable in normal flow is the best way to begin any webpage.
  It ensures that your content is readable even if the user's using a very limited browser or a device such as a screen reader that reads out the content of the page.
  In addition, since normal flow is designed to make a readable document, by starting in this way you're working with the document rather than struggling against it as you make changes to the layout.

The process begins as the boxes of individual elements are laid out in such a way that any padding, border, or margin they happen to have is added to their content. This is what we call the box model.
By default, a block level element's content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it and grows along the block dimension to accommodate its content.
The size of Inline elements is just the size of their content. 
You can't set width or height on inline elements — they just sit inside the content of block level elements. If you want to control the size of an inline element in this manner, 
you need to set it to behave like a block level element (e.g., with display: block; or display: inline-block;, which mixes characteristics from both).

That explains how elements are structured individually, but how about the way they're structured when they interact with one another? The normal layout flow (mentioned in the layout introduction article) 
is the system by which elements are placed inside the browser's viewport

Each element will appear on a new line below the last one, with each one separated by whatever margin that's been specified. In English, for example, (or any other horizontal, top to bottom writing mode) 
block-level elements are laid out vertically.

Inline elements behave differently. They don't appear on new lines; instead, they all sit on the same line along with any adjacent (or wrapped) text content as long as there is space for them to do so 
inside the width of the parent block level element. If there isn't space, then the overflowing content will move down to a new line.

If two vertically adjacent elements both have a margin set on them and their margins touch, the larger of the two margins remains and the smaller one disappears. This is known as margin collapsing. 
Collapsing margins is only relevant in the vertical direction

/* 
Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

Here are the block-level elements in HTML:
<address> <article> <aside> <blockquote> <canvas> <dd> <div> <dl> <dt> <fieldset> <figcaption> <figure> <footer> 
<form> <h1>-<h6> <header> <hr> <li> <main> <nav> <noscript> <ol> <p> <pre> <section> <table> <tfoot> <ul> <video>
*/

/* 
Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line.
An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

Here are the inline elements in HTML:
<a> <abbr> <acronym> <b> <bdo> <big> <br> <button> <cite> <code> <dfn> <em> <i>< img> <input> <kbd> <label> <map> 
<object> <output> <q> <samp> <script> <select> <small> <span> <strong> <sub> <sup> <textarea> <time> <tt> <var>

Note: An inline element cannot contain a block-level element!
*/


/* 
The <div> Element
The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.
The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content:
*/

<div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
</div>

/* 
The <span> Element
The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
<div> Defines a section in a document (block-level)
<span> Defines a section in a document (inline)
When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text:
*/
<p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold;">dark green</span> eyes.</p>




/* 
display: inline-block brought a new way to create side by side boxes that collapse and wrap properly depending on the available space in the containing element.

Compared to display: inline, the major difference is that inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element. Also, with display: inline, top and bottom margins
& paddings are not respected, and with display: inline-block they are.

Now, the difference between display: inline-block and display: block is that, with display: block, a line break happens after the element, so a block element doesn’t sit next to other elements
