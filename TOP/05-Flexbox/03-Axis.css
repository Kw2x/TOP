/* 
The most confusing thing about flexbox is that it can work either horizontally or vertically, and the way some rules work changes a bit depending on which direction you are working with.
The default direction for a flex container is horizontal, or row, but you can change the direction to vertical, or column. The direction can be specified in CSS like so
*/

.flex-container {
  flex-direction: column;
}

/* 
Axes
No matter which direction you’re using, you need to think of your flex-containers as having 2 axes: the main axis and the cross axis. 
It is the direction of these axes that changes when the flex-direction is changed. In most circumstances, flex-direction: 
row puts the main axis horizontal (left-to-right), and column puts the main axis vertical (top-to-bottom).

In other words, in our very first example, we put display: flex on a div and it arranged its children horizontally. This is a demonstration of flex-direction: row, the default setting. 
The following example is very similar. If you uncomment the line that says flex-direction: column, those divs will stack vertically.
*/

<div class="flex-container">
  <div class="one"></div>
  <div class="two"></div>
  <div class="three"></div>
</div>

flex-container {
    display: flex;
    /* flex-direction: column; */
  }
  
  /* this selector selects all divs inside of .flex-container */
  .flex-container div {
    background: peachpuff;
    border: 4px solid brown;
    height: 80px;
    flex: 1 1 auto;
  }

  /* 
  One thing to note is that in this example, flex-direction: column would not work as expected if we used the shorthand flex: 1. Try it out now (i.e. go change the flex value on the flex: 1 1 auto; line). 
  Can you figure out why it does not work if flex: 1 is used? The divs collapse, even though they clearly have a height defined there.

  The reason for this is that the flex shorthand expands flex-basis to 0, which means that all flex-growing and flex-shrinking would begin their calculations from 0. 
  Empty divs by default have 0 height, so for our flex items to fill up the height of their container, they don’t actually need to have any height at all.

  The example above fixed this by specifying flex: 1 1 auto, telling the flex items to default to their given height. We could also have fixed it 
  by putting a height on the parent .flex-container, or by using flex-grow: 1 instead of the shorthand.

  Another detail to notice: when we changed the flex-direction to column, flex-basis refers to height instead of width. Given the context this may be obvious, but it’s something to be aware of.

  The default behavior is flex-direction: row which arranges things horizontally. The reason this often works well without changing other details in the CSS is 
  because block-level elements default to the full width of their parent. Changing things to vertical using flex-direction: column adds complexity because block-level elements default 
  to the height of their content, and in this case there is no content.
