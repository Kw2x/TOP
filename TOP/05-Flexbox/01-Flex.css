Introduction To Flexbox
Flexbox is a way to arrange items into rows or columns. These items will flex (i.e. grow or shrink) based on some simple rules that you can define.

Flex Containers and Flex Items
As you’ve seen, flexbox is not just a single CSS property but a whole toolbox of properties that you can use to put things where you need them. 
Some of these properties belong on the flex container, while some go on the flex items. This is a simple yet important concept.

A flex container is any element that has display: flex on it. A flex item is any element that lives directly inside of a flex container.

Somewhat confusingly, any element can be both a flex container and a flex item. Said another way, you can also put display: 
flex on a flex item and then use flexbox to arrange its children.

Creating and nesting multiple flex containers and items is the primary way we will be building up complex layouts. The following image was achieved using only 
flexbox to arrange, size, and place the various elements. Flexbox is a very powerful tool.

Growing And Shrinking

The Flex Shorthand
The flex declaration is actually a shorthand for 3 properties that you can set on a flex item. These properties affect how 
flex items size themselves within their container. You’ve seen some shorthand properties before, but we haven’t officially defined them yet.

Shorthand properties are CSS properties that let you set the values of multiple other CSS properties simultaneously. 
Using a shorthand property,you can write more concise (and often more readable) stylesheets, saving time and energy.

In this case, flex is actually a shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis. Where flex is 1
Very often you see the flex shorthand defined with only one value. In that case, that value is applied to flex-grow. 
So when we put flex: 1 on our divs, we were actually specifying a shorthand of flex: 1 1 0.

Flex-Grow
flex-grow expects a single number as its value, and that number is used as the flex-item’s “growth factor”. When we applied flex: 1 
to every div inside our container, we were telling every div to grow the same amount

The result of this is that every div ends up the exact same size. If we instead add flex: 2 to just one of the divs, then that div would grow to 2x the size of the others.


Flex-Shrink
flex-shrink is similar to flex-grow, but sets the “shrink factor” of a flex item. flex-shrink only ends up being applied if the size of all flex items is larger than their parent container. 
The default shrink factor is flex-shrink: 1, which means all items will shrink evenly. If you do not want an item to shrink then you can specify flex-shrink: 0;. 
You can also specify higher numbers to make certain items shrink at a higher rate than normal.
An important implication to notice here is that when you specify flex-grow or flex-shrink, flex items do not necessarily respect your given values for width.

In the above example, all 3 divs are given a width of 250px, but when their parent is big enough, they grow to fill it. 
Likewise, when the parent is too small, the default behavior is for them to shrink to fit. This is not a bug, but it could be confusing behavior if you aren’t expecting it.

Flex-Basis
flex-basis simply sets the initial size of a flex item, so any sort of flex-growing or flex-shrinking starts from that baseline size.

The shorthand value defaults to flex-basis: 0%. The reason we had to change it to auto in the flex-shrink example is that with the basis set to 0, 
those items would ignore the item’s width, and everything would shrink evenly. Using auto as a flex-basis tells the item to check for a width declaration (width: 250px).

Important Note About Flex-Basis:
There is a difference between the default value of flex-basis and the way the flex shorthand defines it if no flex-basis is given. 
The actual default value for flex-basis is auto, but when you specify flex: 1 on an element, it interprets that as flex: 1 1 0. 
If you want to only adjust an item’s flex-grow you can simply do so directly, without the shorthand. Or you can be more verbose and 
use the full 3 value shorthand flex: 1 1 auto, which is also equivalent to using flex: auto.

What is flex: auto?
If you noticed, we mentioned a new flex shorthand flex: auto in the previous note. However we didn’t fully introduce it. flex: auto is one of the shorthands of flex. 
When auto is defined as a flex keyword it is equivalent to the values of flex-grow: 1, flex-shrink: 1 and flex-basis: auto or to flex: 1 1 auto using the flex shorthand. 
Note that flex: auto is not the default value when using the flex shorthand despite the name being “auto” which may be slightly confusing at first. 
You will encounter and learn more about flex: auto and its potential use-cases when reading through the assignment section.

In practice you will likely not be using complex values for flex-grow, flex-shrink or flex-basis. Generally, you’re most likely to use declarations like flex: 1; 
to make divs grow evenly and flex-shrink: 0 to keep certain divs from shrinking.
