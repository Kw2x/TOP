<!--
It’s worth noting you can use anchor tags 
to link to any kind of resource on the internet, 
not just other HTML documents. You can link to videos, pdf files, 
images, and so on, but for the most part, you will be linking to other HTML documents.
-->

<!--
Links to pages on other websites on the internet are 
called absolute links. A typical absolute link will be made up of the following parts: 
protocol://domain/path. An absolute link will always contain the protocol and domain of the destination.

<!--
Links to other pages within our own website are called relative links. Relative links do not include the domain name, 
since it is another page on the same site, it assumes the domain name will be the same as the page we created the link on.
Relative links only include the file path to the other page, relative to the page you are creating the link on.

<img>
<!--
To display an image in HTML we use the <img> element. Unlike the other elements we have encountered so far, 
the <img> element is empty. Which means it doesn’t have a closing tag.
Instead of wrapping content with an opening and closing tag, it embeds an image into the page using a src 
attribute which tells the browser where the image file is located. The src attribute works much like the 
href attribute for anchor tags. It can embed an image using both absolute and relative paths.
-->

<!--
In many cases, this will work just fine; however, you can still run into unexpected issues with this approach. 
Prepending ./ before the link will in most cases prevent such issues. By adding ./ you are specifying to your 
code that it should start looking for the file/directory relative to the current directory.
-->

<!--
What if we want to use the dog image in the about page? We would first have to go up one level out of the pages 
directory into its parent directory so we could then access the images directory. To go to the parent directory 
we need to use two dots in the relative filepath like this: ../
-->

<!--
Besides the src attribute, every image element should also have an alt (alternative text) attribute. The alt 
attribute is used to describe an image. It will be used in place of the image if it cannot be loaded. It is 
also used with screen readers to describe what the image is to visually impaired users.
